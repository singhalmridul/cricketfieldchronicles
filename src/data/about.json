    "title": "About Cricket Field Chronicles",
    "story": "I started Cricket Field Chronicles to narrate unheard cricket stories. Stories that remain largely unknown. I wanted to present the game in a way where we are able to look at it beyond number, statistics, comparisons and predictions. Especially in the South Asian Countries, where Cricket finds itself engrained in culture, language and identity. It is my vision with CFC to break the recency phenomenon and keep alive the moments and memories that have made the game what it is today.\n\nAlong in this journey, I discovered that no other sport in the world inspires as much literature as cricket does - a testament to cricket's unique ability to offer new perspectives and life-altering insights. This motivated me to showcase and highlight cricket literature and helps cricket fans in staying connected with the game. CFC has one of the largest collection of Book reviews and recommendations. We collaborate with acclaimed book authors and leading publishing houses of India to bring you honest and unbiased content related to cricket books.\n\nWe also host fan meetups and organize match tours and screenings.\n\nCricket Field Chronicles celebrates this beautiful sport, its fans and its many stories.",
